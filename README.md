The bugs I ran into were css grid bugs I couldn't get my card layout to work or my nav so I copied and altered code for Jen simmons codepen, mozilla, and w3c.
my benefit is that I now know how to code these things so on my next assignment I will do my best to not copy code. I couldn't figure out how to get the MIT license on here after you create the repository because I had tried it
when I was creating the repository but then I could not push the git to the repository.
Atrributes: I took html and css for most of my page from Mozilla, W3C, and Jen Simmons Codepen.
